How to invoke a command:

To retrieve information about our docker configuration:

### Images vs Containers
Images are the binaries containing all the libraries and resources.

Containers are the instances containing and image.

The docker default "registry" is called Docker Hub (hub.docker.com).

#### Running an example

> docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

This command will expose an nginx instance in your machine (localhost).

Â¿What made the command?
* Downloaded the nginx image from Docker Hub
* Started a new container with that image
* Opened port 80 on the host IP
* Routes the traffic to the container IP, port 80
