# **Docker notes**

## **Docker commands**

How to invoke a command:
> docker < command > < sub-command > (options)

To retrieve information about our docker configuration:
> docker info

To verify that docker can talk with CLI:
> docker version

### Images vs Containers
Images are the binaries containing all the libraries and resources.

Containers are the instances containing and image.

The docker default "registry" is called Docker Hub (hub.docker.com).

#### Running an example

> docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

This command will expose an nginx instance in your machine (localhost).

Â¿What made the command?
* Downloaded the nginx image from Docker Hub
* Started a new container with that image
* Opened port 80 on the host IP
* Routes the traffic to the container IP, port 80

Running in detached mode:
Docker can run containers in detached mode, in this way the container will 
run as a service independently:

> docker container run --publish 80:80 --detached nginx

Specifying the name for the container (needs to be unique):

> docker container run --publish 80:80 --detached --name [name] nginx

To delete our containers:

> docker container rm [id1] [id2] [id3]...

Docker in this scenario will:
* Look for the image in the local cache
* If not find anything will look in the repositories (Docker Hub in this case)
* Unless other thing specified docker will download the latest version
* Creates the container in the way previously discussed

### Container vs VMs

Containers aren't mini-vm's, containers are just processes and are limited only 
to the resources of the process.

Some useful commands for containers:

Process list in one container:
> docker container top

Details of one container config:
> docker container inspect

Performance stats for all containers:
> docker container stats

### Getting a Shell inside the container

> docker container run [command_to_run_in_container] --name [container_name]
> [container_image] [default_command]

## **Docker networking**

By default:
* Each container to a private network "bridge"
* Each virtual network routes trough NAT firewall on host IP
* All containers in a virtual network can talk with each others without -p
* Best practice is to create a new virtual network for each app.

Show networks:
> docker network ls

Inspect a network:
> docker network inspect

Create a network:
> docker network create --driver

Attach a network to container:
> docker network connect

Detach a network from container:
> docker network disconnect

### The DNS

DNS is the key for easy inter-container communications.

Forget about IP's, the Addresses can change in every deploy, **the solution 
is to use names**. To make this more easy you need to use your **custom networks**.
